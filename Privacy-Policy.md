## Introduction
 Developers of Piwigo-Mobile, we (or “us” or “our”) respect the privacy of our users (“user” or “you”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the “Application”). Our names can be extracted from the meta data in the git repository and the Acknowledgements section within the Application.

 Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the application.

 We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy.

You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

 This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-app virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

## What data is processed and stored?

## Android Permissions
The application requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions
- **Read/modify Accounts**

    Access to different Piwigo galleries is supported using different accounts and the corresponding passwords. Those are managed by Androids AccountManager, which in turn requires this permission.

- **Read from/write to Storage** (Photos/Media/Files)

    Files are accessed to be uploaded to the connected Piwigo gallery.


- **Piwigo Gallery Data**

     Account credentials are stored by the application and submitted to the configured sites to connect to one or several Piwigo galleries. Beside that, all the photos, videos and files that are selected for download/upload and the entered content is stored, processed and transmitted to the configured gallery site.
 
- **Mobile Device Access**

     The Application may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device’s photo library, local and connected cloud storage. If you wish to change the access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings but be aware that the access to device storage is necessary to upload media files it contains to the Piwigo gallery or to store Piwigo media files in your local or connected cloud storage. By the use of "store" and "share" functionality photos, videos and other data is transferred to other applications on the device, as selected by the user.

- **Mobile Device Data**

     Device information such as your mobile device ID number, model, and manufacturer, version of your operating system, screen resolution and orientation, email, country, language, location, and any other data you choose to provide may be transmitted to the development team of the application, in case you submit a bug or crash report. Beside the data explicitly shared by the user with the developers no content will be stored, transmitted or processed by the Piwigo-Mobile team. It is under your responsibility to review the data in the crash report before sending it to ensure it doesn't contain sensitive data that you don't want to be publicly shared. These data are collected to improve the application and solve misbehavor and are stored in our mailboxes and on the computers of the development team and kept for future reference. In case you do not want to share part or all of the data in the prepared crash report do not decide to transmit it.

## Why does Piwigo-Mobile store data?

 This application stores only data to satisfy its intention: accessing a Piwigo gallery hosted on a foreign webserver. No data is collected, transmitted or stored that is not required for its intended functionality.
 
 When you access the Application, your personal information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. We only use caching mechanisms to help customize the Application and improve your experience. You can disable or clear caches from the Settings section, but be aware that such action could affect the availability, functionality and mainly the performance of the application.

## How is the data protected?
 The application stores data locally on the device running the application. You are responsible to protect the stored data from unauthorized access. We strongly recommend to use HTTPS to protect data during transmission and the Application tries to use HTTPS the first time the user establishes a connection with a Piwigo gallery. Keeping certificates and libraries for HTTPS access up to date is under responsibility of the Piwigo server operator. When the Application cannot use HTTPS, it switches to HTTP and data are not encrypted during transmission.

 When you upload images to a Piwigo gallery, images may contain private data like GPS coordinates or comments. The Application provides an option for removing these data from image files before upload in the Settings section. It is the responsibility of the user to decide whether those private data are uploaded.

## Security of your information
 We use technical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.
