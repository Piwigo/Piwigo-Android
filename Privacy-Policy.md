# Privacy Policy
Piwigo-Android is a free, libre and open source client application for Piwigo galleries. This privacy policy applies to the Android application, connecting to user configured Piwigo sites, which are out of the control of the authors. Check the privacy policy of the corresponding sites before configuring an account in Piwigo-Android to connect to a gallery.

## Who are the authors of Piwigo-Android?
This application is developed by a loose team of developers in the Piwigo-Mobile team and contributors. Their names can be extracted from the meta data in the git repository and the about section within the application.

## What data is processed and stored?
Account credentials are stored by the application and submitted to the configured sites to connect to one or several Piwigo galleries. Beside that all the photos and files that are selected for upload and the entered content is stored, processed and transmitted to the configured gallery site. In case the user decide to send a report in case of a crash data about the devices' configuration and the executed operation is transmitted to the development team of this application. By the use of "store" and "share" functionality data is also transferred to other applications on the device, as selected by the user. Beside the data explicitly shared by the user with the developers no content will be stored, transmitted or processed by the Piwigo-Mobile team.

## Why does Piwigo-Android store data?
This application stores only data to satisfy its intention, accessing a Piwigo gallery hosted on a foreign webserver. No data is collected, transmitted or stored that is not required for its intended functionality.

## How is the data protected?
Piwigo-Android stores data locally on an Android device. The user is responsible to protect the stored data from unauthorized access. Transmission of data between the application and a Piwigo site is performed over the user selected protocol, which might or might not be encrypted. The authors of Piwigo-Android strongly recommend to use HTTPS to protect data during transmission. Keeping certificates and libraries for HTTPS access up to date is under responsibility of the device operator.

## Android Permissions
The application requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions
- **Read/modify Accounts**

    Access to different Piwigo galleries is supported using different accounts and the corresponding passwords. Those are managed by Androids AccountManager, which in turn requires this permission.

- **Read from/write to Storage** (Photos/Media/Files)

    Files are accessed to be uploaded to the connected Piwigo gallery.

## Changes in the policy
The current version of this privacy policy took effect Oct 22, 2018.
Material changes in this policy will be highlighted at startup of the application after updating. The history can always be viewed in the [git repository of the project](https://github.com/Piwigo/Piwigo-Android).
